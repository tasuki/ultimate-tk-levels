Hi folks, how is it going?

This is my first episode and I hope you will enjoy it.

"Kill the Blockhead"

You are playing me and/or Heiko, two maniac daredevils who live in the shadows.
Mr. Johnson wants you to stop the machinations of the evil dictator Baron Furzimarsch.
Baron Furzimarsch is known to act without any scruple if it will help
him to achieve his goal: To take over the world !!!
Ok, now you think: whao, that's a new one!... I know and you are right but
concerning highly confidential information he has built a new weapon which
is supposed to be so cruel and so terrible that the whole world is threatened!!! 
Now he is creating a mashine which will enable him to use his weapon on 
any country and on anyone, everywhere! 

Therefore your first target will be to 
find this machine, to destroy it and to kill all his scientists. Although...most
of them were indeed captured by Furzimarsch and forced to work for him...hmm...
well, that doesn't matter and as the president knows how much you enjoy killing 
innocent people, consider it as part of your bonus.  

Your second target will be then to find and kill Baron Furzimarsch (and of course to 
kill everyone else you meet). It is believed that he has a secret hideout in his 
headquarter Schloss Wolfensteig where he is also supposed to produce his new weapon. 

Equip yourself with the finest of Ares Heavy Industries and kick asses!

You are mankind's last hope.

Good luck
