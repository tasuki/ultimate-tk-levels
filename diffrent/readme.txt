4.0 STORY
    =====

You're working at a pleasure ground. Now you're testing a modernized
fun house. But unfortunately, there's hiding a terrorist gang (which
has just robbed a bank). The gang tries to ...of course... slaughter
you at all costs. Fight your way out of the fun house through all the
bad guys...or die!


5.0 HINTS
    =====

It may be nice to search for my nick names, but don't lower yourself to
cheat.

  5.1 Hints for Different
      -------------------

  I've hidden three FOX-signs to this episode. Let's see if you can
  find all of them without using Editor to search the levels. It may be
  difficult to locate them while you're playing.

  In level 9 lies number 9 (look at the level's map), which has nothing
  to do with the level's ordinal. It's something completely different.
  Those, who recognize my name (or is it a nick name?), should know,
  what number 9 stands for.

  5.2 Cheat Codes
      -----------

  Change the name of player1 into "iron" and player2 into "maiden"
  (without the quotation marks) and the players will get 50000 of
  money.

  5.3 Hints for the Whole Game
      ------------------------

  Murder, butcher, slaughter, slice, chop, waste, crush, shoot, blow,
  smash, massacre, slay, beat, execute, terminate, behead, decapitate,
  mash, mince, split, kill 'em all!


6.0 VIRUS SAFETY
    ============

Different is completely virus free. Checking for viruses was done by
an antivirus program "Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit for Win95 version
7.91" (which identifies 24709 viruses, trojans and variants).


7.0 THE AUTHOR HAS SOMETHING TO SAY
    ===============================

My target on making this (my first) episode was to make it as unusual
and abnormal compared with other levels made by other people as
possible. The levels had to be weird because the game is played in a
fun house (check out 4.0).

I had problems on making a good level of difficulty because this is
the first episode, I've made (second one is under construction). I hope
that I get justified(!) feedback by email as soon as possible before
releasing my second episode.

  7.1 Thanks
      ------

  Thanks for the following persons, whose help on making the episode
  was necessary:

   * Steelpounder was the beta tester and took big responsibility on
     evaluating my levels
   * Erik Lindroos taught me on using Editor (there is editor.txt with
     TK to instruct but it's more comfortable to study with a friend)
   * Allu & Unski, who created a new dimension to the world
     of computer games named Tapan Kaikki

  7.2 Copyrights
      ----------

  This freeware-episode can be distributed as long as these two
  text files "lueminut.txt" and "readme.txt" are included. Its levels
  can be used as a base of new levels, but I must be creditted.
