Description             : an extremelly high quality episode of 11 levels with
			  a detailed story which fits in perfectly with them
			  . It is not immposibly hard, the first few levels 
                          are easy but things hot up later on, all the levels
			  are designed to be entertaining, not immpossible.
			  As an additon, they are all optimised for
			  deathmatch play. The levels are very different in
			  difficulty, style and size and so give a rewarding
			  single and multiplayer experience.
			  
                         
Additional Credits to   : Error Free, for making the brilliant TK.
			  Andrew Gordon and Oliver Lister for multiplayer
			  testing.

                                 -Level 1-
				  Accident

	You and your brother run a car garage to the side of a highway.
Outside is your customised 'Hot Rod'. Your busy working on a car one day when
you here a huge explosion followed by the sound of gunfire. Grabbing your 
pistol you go out to see what has happened. It looks like a huge
army has gone through. After killing the remaider of the army you follow
the trail of devastation.

			 	-Level 2-
			       Institution

	You come across a huge building and enter. After killing all
the people who threaten you, you notice on a computer screen blueprints for
a huge, armoured, tank-tracked, personal carrier. This is not good, it seems
that an mad dictator plans to destroy Washington DC with this vehicle and a
huge mind controlled army!! You must destroy the army to save America! You
reload your shotgun and go deeper into the building.

				-Level 3-
			       Secret Road

	In the basement of the building you come across an underground road
which leads to a large factory. After killing the mind controlled shotgun 
guards, you follow the road.

				-Level 4-
			       Docking Bay
	
	The road leads to a huge nuclear powered arms factory, you read
on a computer screen that Mr. Mad Dictator is building an underground army
base filled with his own built weaponry and with the local population of
Pleasantville as its soldiers! (add dramatic music) Cocking your pistol, you
enter the path that leads to the army base.

				-Level 5-
			       Secret Army

	That was tough but you wiped out all the army stationed at the base
, now to find away out. Remebering the computer in the factory you recall
there is a way out through the back of the base which is stil under 
construction. After raiding the store rooms you enter the back of the 
underground base. 

				-Level 6-
			    Under Construction

	You enter the boiler room which heats the base and notice that the
rest of the base is still under construction. You know there is a way to the
surface, but you have yet to find it. The area is superhot with the combined
heat of the boilers and the small fissures which ooze with lava.

				-Level 7-
			        Resurface

	Finally you reach the surface! Mr. Mad Dictator seems to have another
supply line going to the base from the highway. Unfortunately His evil mind
control has reached here already. To stop him taking control and gaining a
bigger army you will have to go to Pleasantville and neutralise it's
inhabitants.

				-Level 8-
			      Pleasantville

	Here you are, Pleasantville, you hate to do this, but every one must
DIE! After killing the population you notice a scrap of paper sticking out
of the pocket on the severed leg of a commando. Wiping off the blood you see
a map of the location of the secret jungle factory that is manufacturing the
tank-tracked, heavily-armed personnel carrier. You hot wire a car and drive 
there.

				-Level 9-
			       Power Source

	After pushing through the jungle you come across the factory. It's
heavily defended. but you manage to get in and move towards the hangar where 
The Machine is built.

				-Level 10-
				The MACHINE

	You get there, it's huge, and heavily defended. The machine is
mounted on 2 large tank tracks and has 2 massive pincers, 2 Heavy Launchers,
2 Grenade launchers and 2 close range Flame throwers. It has 2 floors, the top
has the controls for The Machine, and the bottom contains the army. An idea
forms, you hide in a compartment and wait for the army to arrive. Unfortunately
The door locks and you cant escape. After awhile of struggeling you hear the
army arrive and The Machine starts to trundle towards Washington DC.

				-Level 11-
			         Too late

	You manage to force the door open and rush out. Blam Blam Blam!
you shoot controllers of The Machine dead and It stumbles to a halt. Now for
the army.
